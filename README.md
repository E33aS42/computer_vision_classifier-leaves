# computer_vision_classifier-leaves
Computer Vision classifier using a VGG16 pretrained model on an augmented and transformed dataset of diseased leaves images.

This is a school project that was divided into 4 parts

# Part 1 : Data analysis

The dataset consists of 8 classes of apple and grape tree leaves, 1 healthy class and 3 diseases classes for each fruit tree.
Looking at the data shows that it is clearly unbalanced.

# Part 2 : Dataset augmentation and balancing

In order to balance the dataset, new images were created from the existing images using different images transformations.
